> *A spiritual successor to Frontier, reimagined for the modern era.*

PrismaticOutpost is a revolutionary, open-source development environment that empowers creators, developers, and business users alike.
It combines the flexibility of scripting, the power of databases, and the ease of use of modern applications into one seamless package.

## üåü Features

- **üìä Dock-based Tiling Interface**: Effortlessly manage multiple projects as separate Workspaces, with tiling window management for each workspace.
- **üöÄ Scheme Scripting**: Harness the power of Scheme for automation and customization. Other scripting languages will be added as soon as possible.
- **üóÑÔ∏è Hierarchical Data Storage**: SQLite-backed, accessible right inside your code as `dot.notation.paths.to.any.database.record`.
- **üåê Web-Ready**: Run scripts in sandboxed environment directly within the interface, or deploy them online instantly as webassembly apps. Sensitive backend scripts can be triggered remotely with strong authentication and built-in SSL.
- **üîÑ Cross-Platform**: Scripts are compiled to WebAssembly for unparalleled compatibility and execution speed.
- **üîó Public Sharing**: Instantly share your work with ngrok integration without paying any hosting fees, or deploy it to our cloud infrastructure.
- **üê≥ Docker Integration**: Seamless backend dependency management integrated via the use of Docker images.
- **üìö Documentation: Comprehensive documentation is available both in the program itself (and written using the same Markdown and scripting system as any other PrismaticOutpost document), as well as on Github in the [Wiki](https://github.com/mindfulvector/prismatic-outpost/wiki).
- **üìù Markdown Interface**: Not just for documents, we use Markdown files as a familiar, text-based control surface to manage static site creation and provide template files for scripts.

> *Please note, this project is in the very early stages and most of these features are not yet available. I plan to have them implemented very
quickly, however.*

## üéØ Who It's For

- **Developers**: Streamline your workflow, from concept to deployment.
- **Business Users**: Create powerful, custom solutions without extensive coding knowledge required.
- **Data Analysts**: Manage, analyze, and visualize data with ease.
- **Educators**: Craft interactive learning experiences effortlessly.
- **Hobbyists**: Bring your ideas to life without the usual technical hurdles.

## üí° Inspiration

PrismaticOutpost draws inspiration from Frontier, the groundbreaking userland environment. We aim to carry forward Frontier's
spirit of empowering users with a flexible, scriptable system, web-first and desktop-first system while embracing modern
technologies and development practices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites:

* IDE/Compiler: QtCreator 13.0.1
* Kit: Desktop Qt 6.7.1
* vcpkg (for third party Qt plugins)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prismatic-outpost.git
```

### Windows
To install `jq` and `conan` via `scoop.sh` (must already be installed following the Quickstart section at [scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh/#/)), run the `setup.bat` batch file:
```batch
setup.bat
```

### Linux/macOS
TODO

### Open the project and run it
* Open the directory as a project in QtCreator
* Ensure you are on Debug configuration
* Press F5 to run 


## Creating a PackageKit (either a debug or release build for distribution)
**Note:** This process uses CQtDeployer which you can install from that project's [releases page](https://github.com/QuasarApp/CQtDeployer/releases/tag/v1.6.2365).

To create a PackageKit release, in QtCreator:
1. Run **Build** > **Clean** (select the **Clean** command which is under __Build all Projects for All Configurations__)
2. Run **Build** > **Build all Projects for All Configurations**
3. In a terminal, at the root of the project, run:

```bash
/path/to/CQtDeployer -bin ./build/Desktop_Qt_6_7_1_MinGW_64_bit-Debug/debug/ -qmake /path/to/qmake -targetDir DistributionKit -verbose 3 -debug
```

then run
```bash
/path/to/CQtDeployer -bin ./build/Desktop_Qt_6_7_1_MinGW_64_bit-Release/release/ -qmake /path/to/qmake -targetDir DistributionKit -verbose 3 -debug
```

In both commands, adjust `/path/to/qmake` to the correct path and adjust `Desktop_Qt_6_7_1_MinGW_64_bit` to your exact point release of the Desktop Qt kit.

It is **highly** recommended that you build **both** debug and release PackageKits, and distribute **both** of them to aid in debugging issues that might be encountered.
